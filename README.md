# Stress Detection from Social Media Comments 💬🧠  
This project leverages machine learning to detect **stress-related content** in social media comments. It classifies user-written text into two categories: **Stress** or **No Stress** using a trained Logistic Regression model built on TF-IDF features. It also includes a simple web interface built with Flask for real-time prediction.
